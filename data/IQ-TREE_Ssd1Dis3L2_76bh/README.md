# pseudonuclease_evolution_2020/data/IQ-TREE_Ssd1Dis3L2_76bh/

Data files from phylogenetic analysis of BLASTp results for Dis3L2 homologs in select eukaryotes.

We ran IQ-TREE on the CIPRES server, https://www.phylo.org/

This ran on input data in file:
`data/BLASTp/Ssd1Dis3L2_BLASTp_76species_filteredbyhand_fullseqs_mafft_trimalstrong.fasta`.
This file was mirrored to `infile.txt` in the IQ-TREE directory.

Results and most logfiles are included. We included the tree files and bootstrap estimates, but not the bootstrap replicates.
