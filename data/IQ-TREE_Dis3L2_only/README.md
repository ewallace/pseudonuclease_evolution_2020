# pseudonuclease_evolution_2020/data/IQ--TREE_Dis3L2_only/

Data files from phylogenetic analysis of BLASTp results for Dis3L2-specific homologs in select eukaryotes.

We ran IQ-TREE on the CIPRES server, https://www.phylo.org/ on 17 July 2020.

This ran on input data in file:
`data/Dis3L2_only/Dis3L2_BLASTp_select_fullseqs_mafftlocal_trimal_deltaNterm1to337.fasta`.
This file was mirrored to `infile.txt` in the IQ-TREE directory.

Results and most logfiles are included. We included the tree files and bootstrap estimates, but not the bootstrap replicates.
10000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates.

* _JOBINFO.TXT
* output.bionj
* output.contree
* output.iqtree
* output.log - includes exact function call with parameters, and most results.
* output.mldist
* output.model.gz
* output.splits.nex
* output.treefile - maximum likelihood tree including bootstrap values.
