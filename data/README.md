# pseudonuclease_evolution_2020/data

Data files, both input and output data.

Some analyses are described in relevant logfiles and READMEs in subdirectories of data: 

* multiple sequence alignment (MAFFT)
* alignment processing (TrimAl)
* phylogenetic analysis (IQ-TREE)

## BLASTp

Data relating to BLASTp search for Dis3L2 homologs in select eukaryotes. 
This also found Dis3/Dis3L1/Dss1 homologs.

## Dis3_families

Data relating to the BLASTp output and multiple sequence alignments, for figure 1.

## Dis3L2_only

Data filtered to include only Dis3L2 / Ssd1 - family proteins, for figures 2 and 3.

## IQ-TREE_Ssd1Dis3L2_76bh

IQ-TREE phylogeny results for BLASTp filtered by hand Dis3/Dis3L1/Dis3L2/Dss1 homologs.

## IQ-TREE_Dis3L2_only

IQ-TREE phylogeny results for Dis3L2-specific homologs.
