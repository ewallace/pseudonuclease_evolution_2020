# pseudonuclease_evolution_2020

Evolutionary analysis of Dis3 / RNase II- family enzymes including the Ssd1 pseudonuclease

This repository forms the supplementary data and analysis for the manuscript:

*Repeated evolution of inactive pseudonucleases in a fungal branch of the Dis3/RNase II family of nucleases*; 
E.R. Ballou, A.G. Cook, E.W.J. Wallace. 2020.


Every directory has a README.md that describes the contents in more detail.

## data

Data files, both input and output data.

Some analyses are described in relevant logfiles and READMEs in subdirectories of data: 

* multiple sequence alignment (MAFFT)
* alignment processing (TrimAl)
* phylogenetic analysis (IQ-TREE)

## src

Scripts in R markdown format that do the rest of the data processing and analysis, including making figures used in the manuscript.


## figure

Figures used in the manuscript, output by scripts in src
